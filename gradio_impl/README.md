## Features

- **Easy Configuration:** Our UI provides a simple way to configure the bot persona and prompt style, allowing you to
  personalize your chatbot to your liking.

- **Lightning Fast Generation:** Alpaca-Turbo keeps the model in memory, which makes subsequent generations lightning
  fast, without the need to reload the model for every generation.

- **Persistent Configuration:** We understand the importance of saving your preferences, which is why our UI remembers
  changes between restarts, ensuring you don't have to go through the setup process every time you want to use it.

- **Seamless Chat Experience:** Our web UI ensures that the chat continues even if you restart the script that is
  running in the background, providing you with a seamless chat experience.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We've designed our UI to be easy to use, with a simple interface that doesn't require any
  manual intervention. You can start chatting with our chatbot right away, without any complicated setup.

- **No Endless Printing:** One common problem with other chat UIs is that the bot keeps on printing stuff without
  stopping. That's not the case with Alpaca-Turbo. We've taken steps to ensure that the chatbot only prints when it has
  something to say.

- **History Mode:** Our bot has a history mode that remembers previous conversations, allowing for more personalized and
  engaging conversations.
